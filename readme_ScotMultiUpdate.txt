SCOT MULTIUPDATE 

The new Scot multi-collection version enables the use of different collections, such as English Google Books, Finnish News etc.
A separate database is used for each Scot collection

Changes:
The following changes have been made to Scot, which also require new settings in the Config.json
changes apply to app-files in folder src_vue

1 Config.json
The config.json is the most important point to set up the different collections with their keys, db-connection-strings and display names.
All parts of the application need to know on which collection/db they operate on. Thus, setting the collection key (ie en_books) in config.json is important.
For security reasons, these information need to be set twice (once for public frontend information, once for config of db-server and backend)
Here is an example - en_books and fi_news are the collection_keys

	"host" : "127.0.0.1", ## Identifies the host where scot.py is running
	"collections" : { # collection-database information for backend
		"default" : "mysql://user:password@localhost/scot", # default must be present to catch name errors
		"en_books" : "mysql://user:password@localhost/scot", # assign a database connection string to each collection
		"fi_news" : "mysql://user:password@localhost/scot2"
	},
	"collections_info":{ # information for the frontend
		"English Books": "en_books" # collection_key must match collection_key above "en_books" == "en_books"
		"Finnish News" : "fi_news" 
	}

2. vue.js
Since the frontend needs a default start value at startup before it gets databases_info from the rest-api,
you must enter two start values in vue.js in data:, that match the frontend databases_info
collection_key : "en_books",   
collection_name: "English Books"

That's all for configuration. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To enable multiple collections, the following internal changes have been made

3. vue.js / index.html
Dropdown-selector-box to switch databases
when switching over, the timeslices in the frontend are queried and displayed again (there may be differences between fi-news and google books)

4. scot.py - REST
the rest interface has been changed. Since the collections are hierarchical resources, they are at the beginning of the URL in the Rest interface
There the parameters are passed and transferred to the DB.py

5. db.py - database connector
When initializing the dao (dy.py), the collection name (see config) is passed to the constructor of db.py. db.py then searches for the
matching db-connection-string from the config.json If the key is wrong, it takes the default connection

 
Enjoy.
