# SCoT
SCoT (Sense Clustering over Time) is a web application to view the senses of a word and their evolvement over time. The idea is to help anyone interested in diachronic semantics visualize and compare the meanings a word had at different points in time.

This tool was initially developed in the context of the Master Project "Web Interfaces for Language Processing Systems" at the University of Hamburg in 2019.

For information about current developers, supervisors and related publications, see the GitHub-pages and WebPages of the Language Technology Group of the University of Hamburg.
